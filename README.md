## Senior Physics / Animations Software Engineer 

I've been working on:
- Game Engines and Gameplay. I've worked on AAA titles (shooters and sports simulators) with community of over 400 million players. I've worked on gameplay ability systems, movement, gameplay mechanics, gameplay systems, game engines, multiplayer, asset systems, engine editor, physics, cutscene system, network replications, dlc system, predictions, CI/CD and more.
- Physics. I worked on dynamic physical animations (active ragdolls that is used in replays, highlights system, gameplay movement, humanoid physical contest etc), destruction physics with real-time fracturing, ragdolls, physically-based combat system, resimulations, vehicles, physics optimizations, multi-threaded simulations, network sync etc. I have created a custom physics engine and library with rigidbodies, colliders, GPU physics, GPU particles, GPU clothing, soft bodies and more. 
- Animations. I worked on motion matching (with Kd-tree, HNSW, narrow search), locomotion, motion warping, root motion, limb warping, animation systems, motion replication and interpolation, animation notifications, ACL animations, math movement models, integration with ability system etc.
- Scripting Engine. I created .NET 8 and .NET 8 Native AOT host for the C++ engine with Mono and HostFXR support, I also created a plug-in system with reflection and modules where you can create your own and configure deployment rules or dependencies.  
- Autotesting infrastructure. I have created a cross-platform gameplay test infrastructure that runs nightly on desktops and mobile devices with performance reports generation, analytics, results deployment, network metrics, graphs, embedded package certificates, and stability checks.
