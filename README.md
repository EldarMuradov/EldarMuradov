## Senior Core Engine / Physics Software Engineer 

I'm working on game engines, physics, gameplay, motion matching, movement, animations, tools, network, assets systems and more. 

With great expertise in:
- Game Engine and Gameplay development. I've worked on AAA-level titles (shooters and sports simulators) with community of over 400 million players. I've worked on motion matching (Kd-tree, HNSW based), locomotion, gameplay ability systems, movement, gameplay mechanics, gameplay systems, game engines, multiplayer, asset systems, engine editor, physics, cutscene system, network replications, multiplayer, dlc system, predictions and more.
- Physics. I worked on fluid physics, dynamic physical animations (that is used in replays, highlights system, gameplay movement, humanoid physical contest etc), destruction physics with real-time fracturing, ragdolls, vehicles, etc. I have created a custom physics engine, PhysX-based physics engines (integrated into ecs-based game engine) and an open source library with rigidbodies, colliders, GPU physics, GPU particles, GPU clothing, soft bodies and more. 
- Autotesting infrastructure. I have created a cross-platform gameplay test infrastructure that runs nightly on desktops and mobile devices with performance reports generation, analytics, results deployment, network metrics, graphs, embedded package certificates, and stability checks, 
- Scripting Engine. I created .NET 8 and .NET 8 Native AOT host for the C++ engine with Mono and HostFXR support, I also created a plug-in system with reflection and modules where you can create your own and configure deployment rules or dependencies,
